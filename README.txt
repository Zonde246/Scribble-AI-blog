The blog was made with Emacs org mode (See : https://orgmode.org/). TLDR for anyone wondering how this was made, the .org file is like the source code and I can use Emacs to export it to HTML and PDFs. Shoutout to Fniessen (https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes) who made the wonderful themes and javascript used. And yea most of the content is AI but the code and commands are mostly me (From my own config files). ZonDe19 is my pen name / Gamertag.

VERY IMPORTANT : Keep the "me.png" image and the html file in the same directory or the Main image wont load.
